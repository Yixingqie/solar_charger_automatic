# solar_charger_automatic
August 2016
- In my Solar Power Setup, during the winter, sometimes won't have time to clean off the solar panels.
- Created an automatic charger to charge the Lead Acid Batteries, to prevent them from depleting too much and destroying the cells.
- When the charger turns on, the power is feed through the input of the prebought solar Charger
